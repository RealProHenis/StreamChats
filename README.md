# StreamChats
A very simple program that puts YouTube, Twitch, &amp; Facebook chats side-by-side to easily read when multistreaming

ISSUES:
Facebook chat isn't working since that requires FB to review & approve my developer app which I haven't bothered to follow through on

Also, I know the security on this is BAD. All sensitive data (API keys & secrets) are stored in plain text in the current users registry
